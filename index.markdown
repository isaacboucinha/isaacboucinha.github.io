Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal page.

My name is Isaac Boucinha, and I'm a programmer based out of sunny Lisbon, Portugal. I specialize in web development, in C#, and Javascript.

Lately, I've worked mostly with .NET Core and Angular.

I can help you set up your site, or develop a web app. If you're interested, send me an email.

If you want to check out my previous works, take a look at my portfolio, or my github page.

I love meeting new people, so if you're in Lisbon, I'm almost always up for coffee - just get in touch!
